1D_Schrodinger_simulator.py

Simulates the behaviour of an initially gaussian wavicle. The wavefunction is replaced by a vector spanning the space with discrete steps. The Hamiltonian opertator is replaced by a matrix which includes a discrete second derivative. Eigenfunctions are then the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix. Built in potentials are: harmonic oscillator, potential barrier, and free particle.

2D_Schrodinger_simulator.py

Like with the 1D case, simulates the behaviour of an initially gaussian wavicle. Extra graphs are shown to highlight the real and imaginary behaviour of the wavefunction as well as the potential function.
